# TouchDesigner Projects

This repository is a collection of my **TouchDesigner** projects, created for experimentation, learning, and creative exploration.

## Requirements
**TouchDesigner**  
  All projects require TouchDesigner to run.  
  You can download the free version here:

## Depth-Based Projects

Some projects that use **depth data** require additional setup:

- **Kinect sensor** (supported TouchDesigner-compatible models), **or**
- **TDDepthAnything**, a third-party depth estimation solution

Setting up TDDepthAnything requires additional configuration and is non-trivial. Please refer to the official repository for instructions:  
https://github.com/olegchomp/TDDepthAnything

## Getting Started

1. Install TouchDesigner.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open any `.toe` file using TouchDesigner.

## Notes

- Projects are provided as-is and may vary in complexity or polish, some are still WIP
- All of these were built on a PC with an Nvidia RTX 3060ti, and most have a decent amount of GPU operations, and as such require similar hardware.
